Some of the code modules are not used but are included in the repository.

A MS SQL database back end is needed to provide storage of the data. Other databases can be used after modifying the connection string and SQL provide code. 
The connection string to the database can be either hardcoded into the source files or into an encrypted JSON file which the program will read and decipher according to the values used for the IV and cipher key. This encryption is deactivated in the code.
